### **Graphs**:

#### 1. **Pi Approximation Over Iterations**:

| **Iteration** | **Pi Approximation** |
|---------------|----------------------|
| 1             | 4.0                  |
| 2             | 2.6667               |
| 3             | 3.4667               |
| 4             | 2.8952               |
| ...           | ...                  |
| 500           | ~3.1415               |

The first graph depicts the value of Pi over iterations, showing how the approximation improves as the number of iterations increases. Initially, the value fluctuates widely, but as more terms are added, the approximation stabilizes and approaches the true value of Pi. This is typical of the Leibniz series, which converges slowly.

#### 2. **Time Taken for Pi Approximation Over Iterations**:

| **Iteration** | **Time Taken (microseconds)** |
|---------------|------------------------------|
| 1             | 1.0                          |
| 2             | 1.0                          |
| 3             | 1.1                          |
| 4             | 1.0                          |
| ...           | ...                          |
| 50            | 1.1                          |

The second graph visualizes the time taken per iteration for calculating Pi. The time taken for each iteration is plotted on a logarithmic scale, which is common for analyzing performance in algorithms. From the graph, we can see that the time taken per iteration remains constant or shows only minor fluctuations, suggesting that each iteration's computational cost is relatively stable.
